# Shell Programming Tasks

### Description
Six shell programming tasks are written in scripts folder of this repository. Each task is a shell script. You can run the script by using ```./script_name.sh``` command. Each script has a description of what it does. You can also run the script with ```-h``` flag to get the description of the script.

### Prerequisites
You need to have bash shell installed on your system. You can check if you have bash shell installed by running ```bash --version``` command. If you don't have bash shell installed, you can install it by running ```sudo apt install bash``` command.

## How to run the scripts

### Task 1

To run the script for task 1, you need to pass two arguments to the script. The first argument is the file name that you want to search and the second argument is the folder name in which you want to search the file. You can run the script by using the following command.

For example, if you want to search for a file named ```test.txt``` in the folder ```/home/username```, you can run the script by using the following command.

```./scripts/task1.sh test.txt ~/projects/Shell_programming_tasks/search_files```
